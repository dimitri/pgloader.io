As detailed in the [Migrating to PostgreSQL White Paper](/white-paper) a
database migration to PostgreSQL is set-up in the following 4 steps:

  1. Data migration
  2. Code migration (SQL, Stored Procedure, Application Architecture, etc)
  3. Service migration (maintenance window)
  4. Opportunity cost
  
We can help you at any step above, thanks to our network of Postgres
professionals. We have collectively handled hundreds of migrations to
Postgres, taking into account many different situations, constraints, and
platforms. Whether you are migrating from MySQL or Oracle, MS SQL server or
RDS/Aurora, we can make it easier, and ensure a successful result.
