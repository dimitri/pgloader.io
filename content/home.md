I am publishing a [White Paper](/white-paper/) titled “Migrating to
PostgreSQL, Tools and Methodology” where the idea of [Continuous
Migration](/continuous-migration/) is explained in more details. The paper
also covers migration projects budget decisions and risks mitigation. It's
free and contains all you need to get started, including a PostgreSQL
Architecture primer!

Looking for pgloader's *documentation*? It is now hosted at
<http://pgloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.
