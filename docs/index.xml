      <description>After having been involved in many migration projects in the last 10 years, I decided to publish the following White Paper in order to share my learnings.
The paper is titled Migrating to PostgreSQL, Tools and Methodology and proposed the Continuous Migration approach. Get the book now:
 Continuous Migration makes it easy to make incremental progress over a period of time, and also to pause and resume the migration work later on, should you need to do that.</description>

      <description>pgloader loads data into PostgreSQL. It knows how to load data from several kinds of source:
 Files Live Databases  Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into those two different behaviours of pgloader, starting with its support for migrating a whole database from a connection string.
Loading data from Files You might have to process huge CSV files from time to time. For example if you&amp;rsquo;re in the telco business, those might be Call Detail Records.</description>

      <description>After having been involved in many migration projects over the last 10 years, I decided to publish the following White Paper in order to share my learnings.
The paper is titled Migrating to PostgreSQL, Tools and Methodology and details the Continuous Migration approach. It describes how to migrate from another relational database server technology to PostgreSQL. The reasons to do so are many, and first among them is often the licensing model.</description>

      <description>PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2017 PGConf.EU is a unique chance for European PostgreSQL users and developers to catch up, learn, build relationships, get to know each other and consolidate a real network of professionals that use and work with PostgreSQL.
pgloader, your migration companion Migrating data from another RDBMS to PostgreSQL should be really easy. After all it’s all relations and tables and the same data types everywhere or abouts, with text, dates and numbers.</description>

      <description>The pgloader project is fully Open Source and released under The PostgreSQL License so that anyone can easily contribute to the project. The whole project management (issue tracking, feature proposals, etc) happens on the pgloader github page, in public.
Software development may be open, and the result shared with an Open Source Software licence, but the actual hours of programming are not gratis.
Just like everybody else, I need money for mortgage, kids and food, money I make by doing things with computers, for people who are willing to pay for that.</description>

      <description>The pgloader tool is meant to allow one to implement the Continuous Migration project methodology when migrating to PostgreSQL. This methodology is meant to reduce risks inherent to such complex projects.
After having been involved in many migration projects in the past, I decided to publish a White Paper about this project methodology!
Migrating to PostgreSQL, Tools and Methodology  The migration method proposed here is called Continuous Migration.</description>
